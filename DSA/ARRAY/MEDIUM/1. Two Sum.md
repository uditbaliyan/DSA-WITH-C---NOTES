Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of the provided code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = i+1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    vector<int> num;
                    num.push_back(i);
                    num.push_back(j);
                    return num;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If no pair is found, return an empty vector or throw an exception.
        // This depends on what behavior you want when no pair is found.
        return vector<int>(); // Return an empty vector
    }
};
```

- **Purpose**: The function `twoSum` attempts to find two indices `i` and `j` in the input vector `nums` such that `nums[i] + nums[j]` equals the `target` value.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n^2): The function uses nested loops to check all possible pairs of elements. For each element at index `i`, it iterates through the remaining elements at indices `j` where `j > i`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1) (constant): The additional space used in the function (like variables `i`, `j`, and `num`) does not depend on the size of the input `nums` or `target`. It remains constant regardless of the input size.

- **Explanation**:
  1. The function uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of elements in the `nums` vector.
  2. For each pair (`i`, `j`), it checks if the sum of the elements at those indices equals the `target`.
  3. If a pair is found, it creates a vector `num` with the indices `i` and `j`, and returns it.
  4. If no pair is found, it returns an empty vector to indicate that no valid pair was found.

- **Note**:
  - This approach is straightforward but not the most efficient for large datasets. There's a more efficient approach using a hash map that has a time complexity of O(n) in most cases.

If you want the more efficient hash map-based approach, let me know and I'll provide an explanation for that as well.


<h1>BEST APPROACH</h1>

Certainly! Here's an explanation of the provided code using a hash map:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
       
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(mp.find(target - nums[i]) == mp.end())
                mp[nums[i]] = i;
            else
                return {mp[target - nums[i]], i};
        }
 
        return {-1, -1};
    }
};
```

- **Purpose**: The function `twoSum` attempts to find two indices `i` and `j` in the input vector `nums` such that `nums[i] + nums[j]` equals the `target` value.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n): This approach uses a single pass through the `nums` vector, performing constant time operations for each element. The hash map allows for constant time lookups and insertions, resulting in a linear time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(n): The space used is proportional to the number of elements in the `nums` vector. In the worst case, when all elements are unique, the hash map can store all `n` elements.

- **Explanation**:
  1. The function uses an unordered map (`mp`) to store elements of `nums` as keys and their corresponding indices as values.
  2. It iterates through the `nums` vector using a for loop.
  3. For each element `nums[i]`, it checks if `target - nums[i]` exists in the map (i.e., it checks if there's a complementary element that would sum up to the target).
  4. If not found, it adds `nums[i]` to the map with its index `i`.
  5. If found, it immediately returns a vector containing the indices `{mp[target - nums[i]], i}` which form the desired pair.
  6. If no pair is found after iterating through the entire `nums` vector, it returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate that no valid pair was found.

- **Note**:
  - This approach is more efficient than the nested loop approach because it achieves a time complexity of O(n), compared to O(n^2) for the nested loops. It's particularly advantageous for large datasets.
