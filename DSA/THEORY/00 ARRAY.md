## Array Data Structure in C++

### Theory:

- **Definition**: An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.
- **Properties**:
   - Contiguous memory allocation
   - Fixed size (in most programming languages)
   - Efficient for random access
   - Inefficient for insertions and deletions (except at the ends)
- **Types**:
   - One-dimensional (1D) array
   - Multi-dimensional (2D, 3D, etc.) array

### Common Operations:

- **Access**: Retrieve an element by its index.
- **Insertion**: Add an element at a specified position.
- **Deletion**: Remove an element from a specified position.
- **Traversal**: Visit each element in the array.

### Exceptions:

- **Out of Bounds**: Accessing an index that does not exist.
- **Overflow**: Trying to insert more elements than the array's capacity.
- **Underflow**: Trying to delete from an empty array.

### Coding Examples in C++:

#### Example 1: Accessing Elements

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    cout << arr[2] << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 2: Insertion

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    arr[2] = 10; // Insert 10 at index 2
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 3: Deletion

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    // Delete element at index 2
    for(int i = 2; i < 4; i++)
        arr[i] = arr[i+1];
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 4: Traversal

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        cout << arr[i] << " "; // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 5: Handling Exceptions

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    try {
        cout << arr[10] << endl; // Accessing out of bounds index
    }
    catch (out_of_range& e) {
        cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```


Certainly! Here are some notes on the memory representation of arrays:

---

## Memory Representation of Arrays

### 1. **Contiguous Allocation**:

- Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- This means that the elements of an array are stored one after another in adjacent memory cells.

### 2. **Indexing**:

- Each element in an array is accessed using an index or a subscript.
- The index represents the position of the element in the array.

### 3. **Base Address**:

- The address of the first element in the array is known as the base address or starting address.
- All other elements can be accessed relative to this base address.

### 4. **Element Access**:

- The memory location of the `i`-th element of the array can be calculated using the formula:
  
  ```
  address[i] = base_address + (element_size * i)
  ```

### 5. **Element Size**:

- The size of each element in the array is determined by its data type.
- For example, in an array of integers, each element typically occupies 4 bytes in memory.

### 6. **Memory Efficiency**:

- Contiguous allocation allows for efficient random access to elements using indexing.
- It provides O(1) time complexity for accessing an element.

### 7. **Memory Layout in RAM**:

- In languages like C and C++, arrays are stored in a row-major order, which means that elements in a multi-dimensional array are stored row by row.

### 8. **Multi-dimensional Arrays**:

- Multi-dimensional arrays are essentially arrays of arrays.
- In a 2D array, the elements are laid out in rows and columns.

### 9. **Jagged Arrays**:

- A jagged array is an array of arrays where each row can have a different length.
- It is represented as an array of pointers to arrays.

### 10. **Array Access Time Complexity**:

- Accessing an element in an array has constant time complexity, O(1), because it can be computed directly from the base address and the index.

### 11. **Limitations**:

- The size of the array must be known at compile time in languages like C and C++.
- Resizing an array requires creating a new, larger array and copying the elements.

### 12. **Dynamic Arrays (Vectors)**:

- In some languages like C++, dynamic arrays (vectors) allow for resizing at runtime by automatically managing memory allocation.

### 13. **Memory Diagram**:

- A memory diagram can be used to visualize how elements are stored in an array, showing their addresses relative to the base address.

---

A memory diagram is a visual representation that illustrates how data is stored in computer memory. It helps in understanding the layout of data, including variables, arrays, and other data structures, in a computer's memory. This is particularly important in low-level programming and system design.

Here's an example of a simple memory diagram for an array of integers:

```
Base Address: 0x1000
Element Size: 4 bytes

Index   Address      Value
--------------------------------
0       0x1000       10
1       0x1004       20
2       0x1008       30
3       0x100C       40
4       0x1010       50
```

Explanation:

- **Base Address (Starting Address)**: This is the memory location where the array starts. In this example, it's `0x1000`.

- **Element Size**: This is the number of bytes each element occupies in memory. In this case, it's 4 bytes for each integer.

- **Index**: The index represents the position of the element in the array.

- **Address**: This is the memory location where each element is stored. It's calculated using the formula: `Address[i] = Base Address + (Element Size * i)`.

- **Value**: This is the actual value stored at that memory location.

In the example above, you can see how each element is stored in memory, starting from the base address. The elements are stored contiguously, with each element taking up 4 bytes (since it's an integer).

This is a simplified example. In reality, memory diagrams can get more complex, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, structs, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation. They are an essential tool for understanding how data is organized in memory, which is crucial for efficient programming and debugging.

Understanding how arrays are represented in memory is crucial for efficient manipulation and access of data in programming. It also forms the basis for more advanced data structures and algorithms.

---
Arrays and vectors are both data structures used to store collections of elements in programming. However, they have several key differences:

### Arrays:

1. **Static Size**:
   - Arrays have a fixed size that needs to be defined at compile time.
   - Once created, the size of an array cannot be changed.

2. **Contiguous Memory**:
   - Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.

3. **No Built-in Functions**:
   - Arrays do not have built-in functions for common operations like resizing, adding or removing elements.

4. **Cannot be Directly Copied**:
   - You cannot directly assign one array to another in most programming languages. You need to copy each element individually.

5. **Limited Functionality**:
   - Arrays have limited functionality for dynamic operations like resizing. You need to manually manage memory allocation.

6. **Cannot Store Objects**:
   - Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.

### Vectors:

1. **Dynamic Size**:
   - Vectors are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
   - They automatically manage memory allocation.

2. **Contiguous Memory**:
   - Like arrays, vectors also use contiguous memory locations to store elements.

3. **Built-in Functions**:
   - Vectors come with a rich set of built-in functions for common operations like resizing, adding or removing elements.

4. **Direct Copying**:
   - Vectors can be directly assigned to each other. This includes both the size and the elements.

5. **Can Store Objects**:
   - Vectors can store elements of any data type, including objects.

6. **Standard Library Container**:
   - Vectors are part of the standard template library (STL) in C++, providing a wide range of functions and algorithms to work with them.

### When to Use Which:

- **Use Arrays When**:
   - You know the size of the collection in advance and it won't change.
   - You need a fixed-size structure for performance reasons.
   - You want to manually manage memory allocation.

- **Use Vectors When**:
   - You need a dynamic collection that can grow or shrink.
   - You want to take advantage of built-in functions for common operations.
   - You need to work with collections of varying sizes.

In C++, vectors are often preferred over arrays due to their dynamic nature and the convenience of built-in functions. They provide a balance between flexibility and performance. However, in situations where a fixed-size collection is sufficient and performance is critical, arrays may be preferred.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Here are examples of using arrays and vectors in C++:

### Arrays:

#### Example 1: Initializing and Accessing Elements

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Accessing elements
    cout << "Element at index 2: " << arr[2] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 2: Iterating Through an Array

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Iterating through the array
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 3: Handling Exceptions (Out of Bounds)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    try {
        // Accessing out of bounds index
        cout << arr[10] << endl;
    }
    catch (out_of_range& e) {
        cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Vectors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Accessing elements
    cout << "Element at index 2: " << vec[2] << endl;

    // Iterating through the vector
    for(int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {
        cout << vec[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Adding elements
    vec.push_back(6);

    // Removing elements
    vec.pop_back();

    return 0;
}
```

In the vector example, note that we include the `<vector>` header file to use the vector class from the Standard Template Library (STL). Vectors come with built-in functions like `push_back()` and `pop_back()` for adding and removing elements, respectively. The `size()` function gives the current size of the vector. 

Remember to compile and run these examples to see the output. This will help you understand how arrays and vectors work in practice.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrays are widely used in programming for various purposes. Here are some common use cases for arrays:

1. **Storing Multiple Values of the Same Type**:
   - Arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name. This is useful when you want to organize related data.

   ```cpp
   int scores[5] = {85, 90, 75, 95, 88};
   ```

2. **Iterating Through a Collection**:
   - Arrays provide a convenient way to iterate through a collection of elements, performing operations on each element.

   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       // Access and process scores[i]
   }
   ```

3. **Storing Data from Input**:
   - Arrays can be used to store data from user input, making it easy to process and manipulate that data.

   ```cpp
   int userInput[10];
   for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       cin >> userInput[i];
   }
   ```

4. **Implementing Data Structures**:
   - Data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables can be implemented using arrays.

   ```cpp
   int stack[100];
   int top = -1; // Initialize top for stack implementation
   ```

5. **Efficient Access to Elements**:
   - Arrays allow for direct access to elements based on their index. This provides O(1) time complexity for accessing an element.

   ```cpp
   int thirdElement = arr[2]; // Accessing the third element
   ```

6. **Efficient Memory Usage**:
   - Arrays allocate a fixed amount of memory for a known number of elements. This can be more memory-efficient compared to dynamically allocating memory for each element.

   ```cpp
   int numbers[1000]; // Allocates memory for 1000 integers
   ```

7. **Performing Mathematical Operations**:
   - Arrays are useful for performing mathematical operations on sets of data, such as calculating averages, sums, or finding maximum and minimum values.

   ```cpp
   int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
   int sum = 0;
   for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       sum += numbers[i];
   }
   ```

8. **Sorting and Searching**:
   - Arrays are commonly used for sorting algorithms (like bubble sort, quicksort, etc.) and for searching algorithms (like binary search).

   ```cpp
   // Example: Sorting an array
   int numbers[5] = {10, 5, 8, 2, 7};
   sort(numbers, numbers+5); // Sorts the array in ascending order
   ```

Remember that in C++, arrays have a fixed size once they're created, and they are zero-indexed (the first element is accessed with index 0). If you need dynamic sizing or more functionality, consider using data structures like vectors or other containers provided by the standard library.



-----------
Arrays have various applications in real-life scenarios. Here are a few examples of how arrays are used in everyday life:

1. **Supermarket Shopping**:
   - When you go grocery shopping, you might use an array to keep track of the items you need to buy. Each element of the array could represent a different product, and you can mark them off as you put them in your cart.

2. **Student Grades**:
   - Teachers often use arrays to store and manage student grades. Each student's score can be stored in a separate element of the array.

3. **Calendars**:
   - A calendar on your computer or smartphone could use an array to represent each day of the month. Each element would hold information about appointments, events, or tasks for that day.

4. **Weather Forecast**:
   - Meteorologists use arrays to store and analyze data from weather stations. Each element could represent a different location, and the array could hold information about temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

5. **Seating Arrangements**:
   - In event planning or airline bookings, arrays can be used to represent seat availability. Each element would represent a seat, and its value could indicate whether it's occupied or available.

6. **Music Playlists**:
   - When you create a playlist on a music streaming service, the list of songs is likely stored in an array. Each element corresponds to a different song in the playlist.

7. **Employee Records**:
   - In HR systems, arrays can be used to store employee information. Each element would represent an employee, and the array could hold details like name, ID, position, etc.

8. **Gaming**:
   - In video games, arrays are used extensively. For example, an array could represent the inventory of a character, with each element storing information about a different item.

9. **Sensor Readings**:
   - In IoT (Internet of Things) applications, arrays are used to store data from various sensors. Each element could represent a different sensor, and the array would hold readings like temperature, light level, etc.

10. **DNA Sequencing**:
    - In genetics, DNA sequences are often stored and analyzed using arrays. Each element represents a nucleotide in the sequence.

These are just a few examples to illustrate how arrays are used in practical, everyday situations. They provide a structured way to store and manipulate data, making them a fundamental data structure in computer science and beyond.


----------
Two-dimensional (2D) arrays are commonly used in real-life scenarios where data is organized in a grid or matrix-like structure. Here are a few examples:

1. **Game Boards**:
   - Chess, checkers, Sudoku, and other board games use 2D arrays to represent the game board. Each element of the array corresponds to a specific position on the board.

2. **Images**:
   - Images in digital format are often represented as 2D arrays of pixels. Each element in the array corresponds to a pixel, and the value at that element represents the color or intensity.

3. **Matrices in Mathematics**:
   - Matrices, a fundamental concept in linear algebra, are represented as 2D arrays. They are used in various mathematical operations.

4. **Spreadsheet Programs**:
   - Programs like Microsoft Excel use 2D arrays to store and manipulate tabular data. Each cell in the spreadsheet corresponds to an element in the 2D array.

5. **Terrain Elevation Data**:
   - In geographic information systems (GIS), elevation data for a region is often stored as a 2D array. Each element represents the elevation at a specific point on the map.

6. **Graphs and Grids in Computer Graphics**:
   - In computer graphics, 2D arrays are used to represent grids and images. Each element may represent a pixel or a vertex in a grid.

7. **Solving Puzzles**:
   - Sudoku, for instance, can be solved using a 2D array to represent the puzzle grid, where each element corresponds to a cell.

8. **Tabular Data in Software**:
   - Databases and spreadsheets in software applications often use 2D arrays to store and manipulate data. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field.

9. **Digital Terrain Models (DTMs)**:
   - In geo sciences and remote sensing, DTMs are represented using 2D arrays, where each cell represents the elevation of the terrain at a specific point.

10. **Simulation and Modeling**:
    - 2D arrays are used to simulate and model physical or abstract systems that can be represented in a grid-like fashion.

Remember, 2D arrays are a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating data in a grid-like structure, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.


-------------
Certainly! Sorting algorithms are fundamental operations in computer science. Here are some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms, along with a brief description, algorithm steps, diagrams, and sample code in C++:

### 1. **Bubble Sort**:

- **Description**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Start from the first element.
   2. Compare it with the next element.
   3. Swap if they are in the wrong order.
   4. Move to the next element.
   5. Repeat until the end of the list.
   6. Repeat the process for each element.
   7. Continue until no more swaps are needed.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
   Pass 1: [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
   Pass 2: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
   Pass 3: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Pass 4: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
       for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
           for(int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
               if(arr[j] > arr[j+1])
                   swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Selection Sort**:

- **Description**: Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Divide the array into sorted and unsorted regions.
   2. Find the smallest element in the unsorted region.
   3. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted region.
   4. Expand the sorted region.
   5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
   Pass 1: [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]
   Pass 2: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]

   void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
       for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
           int minIndex = i;
           for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
               if(arr[j] < arr[minIndex])
                   minIndex = j;
           }
           swap(arr[i], arr[minIndex]);
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Insertion Sort**:

- **Description**: Builds a sorted list by repeatedly inserting one element at a time into the correct position within the sorted region.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Divide the array into sorted and unsorted regions.
   2. Pick an element from the unsorted region.
   3. Insert it into the correct position in the sorted region.
   4. Expand the sorted region.
   5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

- **Diagram**:
   ```

   Pass 1: [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]
   Pass 2: [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]
   Pass 3: [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
   Pass 4: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
       for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
           int key = arr[i];
           int j = i - 1;
           while(j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
               arr[j+1] = arr[j];
               j--;
           }
           arr[j+1] = key;
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. **Merge Sort**:

- **Description**: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Divide the array into two halves.
   2. Recursively apply merge sort to each half.
   3. Merge the two sorted halves.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
   Pass 1: [3, 5], [1, 2, 4]
   Pass 2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   void merge(int arr[], int left, int mid, int right) {
       int n1 = mid - left + 1;
       int n2 = right - mid;
       int L[n1], R[n2];

       // Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
       for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
           L[i] = arr[left + i];
       for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++)
           R[i] = arr[mid + 1 + i];

       // Merge the temp arrays back into arr[l..r]
       int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
       while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
           if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
               arr[k++] = L[i++];
           } else {
               arr[k++] = R[j++];
           }
       }

       // Copy the remaining elements of L[], if any
       while (i < n1) {
           arr[k++] = L[i++];
       }

       // Copy the remaining elements of R[], if any
       while (j < n2) {
           arr[k++] = R[j++];
       }
   }

   void mergeSort(int arr[], int left, int right) {
       if (left < right) {
           int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

           // Sort first and second halves
           mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
           mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

           // Merge the sorted halves
           merge(arr, left, mid, right);
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Quick Sort**:

- **Description**: Picks a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and elements

 greater than the pivot are on the right. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
   2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot.
   3. Recursively apply quick sort to each sub-array.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
   Pass 1: [3, 1, 4, 2], [5]
   Pass 2: [1, 2], [3, 4], [5]
   Pass 3: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
       int pivot = arr[high];
       int i = (low - 1);

       for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
           if (arr[j] < pivot) {
               i++;
               swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
           }
       }

       swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);
       return i + 1;
   }

   void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
       if (low < high) {
           int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

           quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
           quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
       }
   }
   ```

### 6. **Heap Sort**:

- **Description**: Converts the unsorted array into a binary heap, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Build a max heap from the input data.
   2. Swap the root element (maximum element) with the last element.
   3. Reduce the size of the heap by one.
   4. Heapify the root element.
   5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the heap is empty.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
   Pass 1: [4, 3, 1, 2, 5]
   Pass 2: [3, 2, 1, 4], [5]
   Pass 3: [2, 1, 3, 4], [5]
   Pass 4: [1, 2, 3, 4], [5]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   void heapify(int arr[], int n, int i) {
       int largest = i;
       int left = 2 * i + 1;
       int right = 2 * i + 2;

       if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
           largest = left;

       if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
           largest = right;

       if (largest != i) {
           swap(arr[i], arr[largest]);
           heapify(arr, n, largest);
       }
   }

   void heapSort(int arr[], int n) {
       for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
           heapify(arr, n, i);

       for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
           swap(arr[0], arr[i]);
           heapify(arr, i, 0);
       }
   }
   ```

### 7. **Radix Sort**:

- **Description**: Distributes elements into buckets based on their digits. It performs this distribution for each digit, moving from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Find the maximum element to determine the number of digits.
   2. Perform counting sort for each digit position from the least significant to the most significant.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
   Pass 1 (Least Significant Digit): [170, 90, 802, 2, 24], [45, 75], [66]
   Pass 2: [802, 2, 24], [45, 66], [170], [75], [90]
   Pass 3 (Most Significant Digit): [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   void countingSort(int arr[], int n, int exp) {
       int output[n];
       int count[10] = {0};

       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
           count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]++;

       for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
           count[i] += count[i - 1];

       for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
           output[count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
           count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
       }

       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
           arr[i] = output[i];
   }

   void radixSort(int arr[], int n) {
       int maxElement = *max_element

(arr, arr + n);

       for (int exp = 1; maxElement / exp > 0; exp *= 10)
           countingSort(arr, n, exp);
   }
   ```

### 8. **Bucket Sort**:

- **Description**: Distributes elements into different buckets and then sorts each bucket individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or recursively applying bucket sort.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Create an array of buckets.
   2. Distribute elements into buckets based on their values.
   3. Sort each bucket.
   4. Concatenate the sorted buckets to get the final sorted array.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Original Array: [0.42, 0.32, 0.33, 0.52, 0.37, 0.47, 0.51]
   Pass 1: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37], [0.42, 0.47], [0.52, 0.51]
   Pass 2: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37], [0.42, 0.47], [0.51, 0.52]
   Sorted Array: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37, 0.42, 0.47, 0.51, 0.52]
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   void bucketSort(float arr[], int n) {
       vector<float> buckets[n];
       
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           int index = n * arr[i];
           buckets[index].push_back(arr[i]);
       }

       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
           sort(buckets[i].begin(), buckets[i].end());

       int index = 0;
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < buckets[i].size(); j++)
               arr[index++] = buckets[i][j];
       }
   }
   ```

These are some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of which algorithm to use depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, the nature of the data, and the desired level of performance. Remember to choose the right algorithm for the specific problem you're solving.

----------------
Certainly! There are several types of searching algorithms commonly used to find elements in an array. Here are some of the most commonly used searching algorithms, along with a brief description, algorithm steps, diagrams, and sample code in C++:

### 1. **Linear Search**:

- **Description**: Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in the array until the target element is found.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Start from the first element of the array.
   2. Compare each element with the target element.
   3. If a match is found, return the index.
   4. If the end of the array is reached without finding the element, return -1.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
   Target: 5
   Pass 1: Compare 4, No match
   Pass 2: Compare 2, No match
   Pass 3: Compare 1, No match
   Pass 4: Compare 5, Match found at index 3
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
       for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           if(arr[i] == target)
               return i;
       }
       return -1;
   }
   ```

### 2. **Binary Search**:

- **Description**: Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays. It compares the target element with the middle element of the array and reduces the search space by half with each iteration.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Compare the target element with the middle element.
   2. If they match, return the index.
   3. If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half.
   4. If the target is greater, search the right half.
   5. Repeat until the element is found or the search space is empty.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Sorted Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Target: 3
   Pass 1: Compare with middle element 3, Match found at index 2
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int target) {
       while (left <= right) {
           int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

           if (arr[mid] == target)
               return mid;

           if (arr[mid] < target)
               left = mid + 1;
           else
               right = mid - 1;
       }

       return -1;
   }
   ```

### 3. **Jump Search**:

- **Description**: Jump search is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays. It works by jumping ahead a fixed number of steps and then performing a linear search in the jumped range.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Determine the block size (jump size).
   2. Jump ahead in the array in block-sized steps.
   3. Perform a linear search within the block if the target element is within the range.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Sorted Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
   Target: 9
   Pass 1: Jump to block [1, 3, 5], Perform linear search, Match found at index 4
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   int jumpSearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
       int step = sqrt(n);

       int prev = 0;
       while (arr[min(step, n) - 1] < target) {
           prev = step;
           step += sqrt(n);
           if (prev >= n)
               return -1;
       }

       while (arr[prev] < target) {
           prev++;
           if (prev == min(step, n))
               return -1;
       }

       if (arr[prev] == target)
           return prev;

       return -1;
   }
   ```

### 4. **Interpolation Search**:

- **Description**: Interpolation search is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays. It calculates the probable position of the target element based on the range of values.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Calculate the probable position of the target element.
   2. Compare the target element with the element at that position.
   3. Adjust the range based on the comparison and repeat.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Sorted Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
   Target: 11
   Pass 1: Probable position = 5, Compare with 9, Adjust range to [11, 13]
   Pass 2: Probable position = 6, Compare with 11, Match found at index 5
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   int interpolationSearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int target) {
       while (left <= right && target >= arr[left] && target <= arr[right]) {
           if (left == right) {
               if (arr[left] == target)
                   return left;
               return -1;
           }

           int pos = left + ((double)(right - left) / (arr[right] - arr[left])) * (target - arr[left]);

           if (arr[pos] == target)
              

 return pos;

           if (arr[pos] < target)
               left = pos + 1;
           else
               right = pos - 1;
       }

       return -1;
   }
   ```

### 5. **Exponential Search**:

- **Description**: Exponential search is a variant of binary search. It first finds a range where the target element may be present, and then performs binary search within that range.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Determine the range where the target element may be present.
   2. Perform binary search within that range.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Sorted Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
   Target: 11
   Pass 1: Range [0, 1], Perform binary search, Match found at index 1
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   int exponentialSearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
       if (arr[0] == target)
           return 0;

       int i = 1;
       while (i < n && arr[i] <= target)
           i = i * 2;

       return binarySearch(arr, i / 2, min(i, n - 1), target);
   }
   ```

### 6. **Hashing (Hash Table)**:

- **Description**: Hashing is a technique that uses a hash function to map keys (in this case, array elements) to their respective values. It allows for constant time average case for search operations.
- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Create a hash table with an appropriate hash function.
   2. Insert elements into the table.
   3. Search for elements using the hash function.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   Hash Table:
   0: [2, 10]
   1: [1, 11]
   2: [12]
   3: [3, 13]
   4: [4, 14]
   5: [5, 15]
   6: [6]
   7: [7]
   8: [8]
   9: [9]
   ```

- **C++ Code** (Using `std::unordered_map`):
   ```cpp
   void hashSearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
       unordered_map<int, vector<int>> hashTable;
       
       for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           int key = arr[i] % 10; // Assuming a simple hash function
           hashTable[key].push_back(arr[i]);
       }

       int key = target % 10;
       auto it = find(hashTable[key].begin(), hashTable[key].end(), target);

       if (it != hashTable[key].end()) {
           cout << "Element found!" << endl;
       } else {
           cout << "Element not found!" << endl;
       }
   }
   ```

These are some of the most commonly used searching algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of which algorithm to use depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, whether it's sorted, and the desired level of performance. Remember to choose the right algorithm for the specific problem you're solving.

----------
Certainly! Searching in a 2D array involves finding a specific element within a grid-like structure. Here are some common types of searching algorithms for 2D arrays, along with explanations, algorithm steps, diagrams, and sample code in C++:

### 1. **Linear Search in a 2D Array**:

- **Description**: This method involves iterating through each element of the 2D array and comparing it with the target value until a match is found.

- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Start at the top-left corner of the array.
   2. Compare the target value with the current element.
   3. If they match, return the coordinates.
   4. If the target is smaller, move right; if larger, move down.
   5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the array.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   2D Array:
   [ 1  4  7 11 ]
   [ 2  5  8 12 ]
   [ 3  6  9 16 ]
   [ 8 10 12 18 ]

   Searching for: 6
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   pair<int, int> linearSearch2D(int arr[][4], int rows, int cols, int target) {
       for(int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
           for(int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
               if(arr[i][j] == target)
                   return {i, j};
           }
       }
       return {-1, -1}; // Not found
   }
   ```

### 2. **Binary Search in a Sorted 2D Array**:

- **Description**: This method applies binary search on both rows and columns of a sorted 2D array to find the target element.

- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Find the mid element of the matrix.
   2. Compare the target value with the mid element.
   3. If they match, return the coordinates.
   4. If the target is smaller, continue searching in the left or upper submatrix.
   5. If the target is larger, continue searching in the right or lower submatrix.
   6. Repeat steps 1-5 until the end of the search space.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   2D Array:
   [ 1  4  7 11 ]
   [ 2  5  8 12 ]
   [ 3  6  9 16 ]
   [ 8 10 12 18 ]

   Searching for: 9
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   pair<int, int> binarySearch2D(int arr[][4], int rows, int cols, int target) {
       int left = 0;
       int right = rows * cols - 1;

       while(left <= right) {
           int mid = (left + right) / 2;
           int midValue = arr[mid / cols][mid % cols];

           if(midValue == target)
               return {mid / cols, mid % cols};

           if(midValue < target)
               left = mid + 1;
           else
               right = mid - 1;
       }

       return {-1, -1}; // Not found
   }
   ```

### 3. **Optimized Search in a Sorted 2D Array**:

- **Description**: This method starts from the top-right corner (or any corner depending on the specific problem) and narrows down the search space based on comparisons with the target element.

- **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Start from the top-right corner of the array.
   2. Compare the target value with the current element.
   3. If they match, return the coordinates.
   4. If the target is smaller, move down; if larger, move left.
   5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.

- **Diagram**:
   ```
   2D Array:
   [ 1  4  7 11 ]
   [ 2  5  8 12 ]
   [ 3  6  9 16 ]
   [ 8 10 12 18 ]

   Searching for: 7
   ```

- **C++ Code**:
   ```cpp
   pair<int, int> optimizedSearch2D(int arr[][4], int rows, int cols, int target) {
       int i = 0, j = cols - 1;

       while(i < rows && j >= 0) {
           if(arr[i][j] == target)
               return {i, j};

           if(arr[i][j] < target)
               i++;
           else
               j--;
       }

       return {-1, -1}; // Not found
   }
   ```

These are three common methods for searching in a 2D array. The choice of algorithm depends on factors like the size and sorted nature of the array, as well as the specific requirements of the problem. Remember to adapt these algorithms based on your specific use case.


-----------
Sorting a 2D array involves arranging its elements in a particular order, which can be based on one of the dimensions (rows or columns) or a combination of both. Here are some common types of sorting for 2D arrays, along with algorithms, diagrams, and example code:

### 1. **Row-Wise Sorting**:

- **Algorithm (Row-Wise Bubble Sort)**:
   1. Start with the first row and compare adjacent elements.
   2. Swap if necessary to arrange them in ascending order.
   3. Move to the next row and repeat steps 1 and 2.
   4. Continue until all rows are sorted.

- **Diagram**:
```
Before Sorting:
[[3, 1, 2],
 [5, 4, 6],
 [8, 7, 9]]

After Sorting:
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```

- **Code** (C++):
```cpp
void bubbleSortRows(int arr[][3], int rows, int cols) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols - 1; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < cols - j - 1; k++) {
                if (arr[i][k] > arr[i][k+1]) {
                    swap(arr[i][k], arr[i][k+1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **Column-Wise Sorting**:

- **Algorithm (Column-Wise Selection Sort)**:
   1. Start with the first column and select the minimum element.
   2. Swap it with the first element in that column.
   3. Move to the next column and repeat steps 1 and 2.
   4. Continue until all columns are sorted.

- **Diagram**:
```
Before Sorting:
[[3, 1, 2],
 [5, 4, 6],
 [8, 7, 9]]

After Sorting:
[[3, 1, 2],
 [5, 4, 6],
 [8, 7, 9]]
```

- **Code** (C++):
```cpp
void selectionSortCols(int arr[][3], int rows, int cols) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < rows - 1; i++) {
            int minIndex = i;
            for (int k = i + 1; k < rows; k++) {
                if (arr[k][j] < arr[minIndex][j]) {
                    minIndex = k;
                }
            }
            swap(arr[i][j], arr[minIndex][j]);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Sorting Based on Specific Condition**:

- You can also sort a 2D array based on a specific condition. For example, sorting based on the sum of each row.

- **Algorithm (Row-Sum Sorting)**:
   1. Calculate the sum of elements in each row.
   2. Sort rows based on their sums.

- **Diagram**:
```
Before Sorting:
[[3, 1, 2],
 [5, 4, 6],
 [8, 7, 9]]

After Sorting:
[[3, 1, 2],
 [5, 4, 6],
 [8, 7, 9]]
```

- **Code** (C++):
```cpp
int rowSum(int arr[], int cols) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < cols; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

void sortByRowSum(int arr[][3], int rows, int cols) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < rows - i - 1; j++) {
            if (rowSum(arr[j], cols) > rowSum(arr[j+1], cols)) {
                for (int k = 0; k <     cols; k++) {
                    swap(arr[j][k], arr[j+1][k]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate different ways to sort a 2D array. Keep in mind that these are simplified examples for illustration purposes and may need to be adjusted based on specific requirements or language nuances.
