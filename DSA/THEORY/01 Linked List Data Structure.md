### Theory:

- **Definition**:
  - A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

- **Types**:
  - Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
  - Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
  - Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.

- **Advantages**:
  - Dynamic size: Easily accommodates new elements.
  - Efficient for insertions and deletions.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Inefficient for random access (searching for an element by index).

### Common Operations:

- **Insertion**:
  - Adding a node at the beginning, end, or middle of the list.

- **Deletion**:
  - Removing a node from the list.

- **Traversal**:
  - Visiting each node in the list.

- **Searching**:
  - Finding a specific element in the list.

### Exceptions:

- **Out of Bounds**:
  - Attempting to access an element at an index that doesn't exist.

- **Null Pointer**:
  - Handling cases where a pointer is null (especially when traversing or accessing elements).

- **Empty List**:
  - Handling operations on an empty list.

### Coding Examples:

#### Example 1: Creating a Singly Linked List

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

class LinkedList {
private:
    Node* head;
public:
    LinkedList() : head(nullptr) {}
    // Add methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.
};
```

#### Example 2: Insertion at the Beginning

```cpp
void LinkedList::insertAtBeginning(int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node{value, head};
    head = newNode;
}
```

#### Example 3: Deletion of a Node

```cpp
void LinkedList::deleteNode(int value) {
    if (head == nullptr) return;
    if (head->data == value) {
        Node* temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
        return;
    }
    Node* current = head;
    while (current->next != nullptr && current->next->data != value) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    if (current->next != nullptr) {
        Node* temp = current->next;
        current->next = current->next->next;
        delete temp;
    }
}
```

#### Example 4: Traversal

```cpp
void LinkedList::traverse() {
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->next;
    }
}
```

#### Example 5: Handling Exceptions

```cpp
int LinkedList::getElementAt(int index) {
    if (head == nullptr)
        throw runtime_error("Empty list");
    Node* current = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
        if (current->next == nullptr)
            throw out_of_range("Index out of bounds");
        current = current->next;
    }
    return current->data;
}
```

Searching and sorting in linked lists involve different approaches compared to arrays. Here are some common methods for searching and sorting in a linked list:

### Searching in a Linked List:

1. **Linear Search**:
   - Traverse the linked list one node at a time and compare the target value with the value of each node until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

   - **Algorithm**:
      1. Start from the head node.
      2. Traverse each node while comparing the value with the target.
      3. If a match is found, return the node or its position.
      4. If the end of the list is reached without finding a match, return a "not found" indication.

   - **Code Example** (C++):
     ```cpp
     Node* linearSearch(Node* head, int target) {
         Node* current = head;
         while (current != nullptr) {
             if (current->data == target) {
                 return current;
             }
             current = current->next;
         }
         return nullptr; // Target not found
     }
     ```

2. **Binary Search (Only for Sorted Lists)**:
   - Binary search is not directly applicable to linked lists since random access is not possible. It's more efficient for arrays.

### Sorting a Linked List:

1. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Build the sorted list one node at a time by removing a node from the original list and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted list.

   - **Algorithm**:
      1. Initialize an empty sorted list.
      2. Traverse the original list.
      3. For each node, remove it from the original list and insert it into the sorted list in the correct position.
      4. Return the sorted list.

   - **Code Example** (C++):
     ```cpp
     Node* insertionSort(Node* head) {
         Node* sorted = nullptr;
         Node* current = head;
         while (current != nullptr) {
             Node* next = current->next;
             sorted = insertIntoSorted(sorted, current);
             current = next;
         }
         return sorted;
     }
     ```

2. **Merge Sort**:
   - Divide the list into two halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge the two sorted lists.

   - **Algorithm**:
      1. If the list is empty or has only one element, it is already sorted.
      2. Otherwise, split the list into two halves.
      3. Recursively apply merge sort to each half.
      4. Merge the two sorted halves.

   - **Code Example** (C++):
     ```cpp
     Node* mergeSort(Node* head) {
         if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
             return head;
         }
         Node* middle = getMiddle(head);
         Node* nextToMiddle = middle->next;
         middle->next = nullptr;
         Node* left = mergeSort(head);
         Node* right = mergeSort(nextToMiddle);
         return merge(left, right);
     }
     ```

These are just a few examples of searching and sorting in linked lists. Keep in mind that there are various other algorithms and approaches that can be used depending on specific requirements and constraints.

      4. If the end of the list is reached without finding a match, return a "not found" indication.

   - **Code Example** (C++):
     ```cpp
     Node* linearSearch(Node* head, int target) {
         Node* current = head;
         while (current != nullptr) {
             if (current->data == target) {
                 return current;
             }
             current = current->next;
         }
         return nullptr; // Target not found
     }

   - **Algorithm**:
      1. Initialize an empty sorted list.
      2. Traverse the original list.
      3. For each node, remove it from the original list and insert it into the sorted list in the correct position.
      4. Return the sorted list.

   - **Code Example** (C++):
     ```cpp
     Node* insertionSort(Node* head) {
         Node* sorted = nullptr;
         Node* current = head;
         while (current != nullptr) {
             Node* next = current->next;
             sorted = insertIntoSorted(sorted, current);
             current = next;
         }
         return sorted;
     }
     ```

2. **Merge Sort**:
   - Divide the list into two halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge the two sorted lists.

   - **Algorithm**:
      1. If the list is empty or has only one element, it is already sorted.
      2. Otherwise, split the list into two halves.
      3. Recursively apply merge sort to each half.

     Node* mergeSort(Node* head) {
         if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
             return head;
         }
         Node* middle = getMiddle(head);
         Node* nextToMiddle = middle->next;
         middle->next = nullptr;
         Node* left = mergeSort(head);
         Node* right = mergeSort(nextToMiddle);
         return merge(left, right);
     }
     ```

These are just a few examples of searching and sorting in linked lists. Keep in mind that there are various other algorithms and approaches that can be used depending on specific requirements and constraints.

-----------------------
In the context of linked lists, overflow and underflow refer to specific situations:

1. **Overflow** in Linked Lists:

   - **Definition**:
     - Overflow in a linked list occurs when you try to insert a new node or element into a list that has reached its maximum capacity or when dynamically allocating memory for a new node fails due to memory constraints.

   - **Causes**:
     - In a statically allocated linked list, overflow happens when you try to add a new node beyond the predefined maximum size.
     - In a dynamically allocated linked list, overflow occurs when the system runs out of memory to allocate for a new node.

   - **Handling**:
     - In most programming languages, when memory allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), it typically throws an exception or returns a null pointer. Proper error handling should be in place to deal with these situations.

   - **Example (C++)**:
     ```cpp
     Node* newNode = new Node(data); // May throw std::bad_alloc on memory overflow
     if (newNode == nullptr) {
         // Handle memory allocation failure
         // ...
     }
     ```

2. **Underflow** in Linked Lists:

   - **Definition**:
     - Underflow in a linked list happens when you attempt to perform an operation, such as deletion or retrieval, on an empty list where no nodes exist.

   - **Causes**:
     - Underflow typically occurs when trying to remove a node from an empty list or when trying to access the head of an empty list.

   - **Handling**:
     - Proper checks should be put in place to ensure that operations that require elements in the list are only performed when the list is not empty.

   - **Example (C++)**:
     ```cpp
     if (head == nullptr) {
         // Handle underflow (e.g., cannot delete from an empty list)
         // ...
     }
     ```

   - **Note**: Handling underflow is important to prevent runtime errors and undefined behavior in your program.

Both overflow and underflow conditions need to be addressed to ensure the correct and reliable functioning of linked lists. This is especially critical in real-world applications where memory management and error handling are crucial components of robust software design.

-------------
Certainly! Here are the algorithms and code examples for insertion and deletion operations in a linked list:

### Insertion Operations:

#### 1. Insertion at the Beginning:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Create a new node with the desired data.
   2. Set the `next` pointer of the new node to point to the current head.
   3. Update the head to point to the new node.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void insertAtBeginning(Node*& head, int data) {
       Node* newNode = new Node(data);
       newNode->next = head;
       head = newNode;
   }
   ```

#### 2. Insertion at the End:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Create a new node with the desired data.
   2. Traverse to the end of the linked list.
   3. Set the `next` pointer of the last node to point to the new node.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void insertAtEnd(Node*& head, int data) {
       Node* newNode = new Node(data);
       if (head == nullptr) {
           head = newNode;
       } else {
           Node* current = head;
           while (current->next != nullptr) {
               current = current->next;
           }
           current->next = newNode;
       }
   }
   ```

#### 3. Insertion After a Given Element:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Create a new node with the desired data.
   2. Locate the node after which you want to insert the new node.
   3. Adjust the `next` pointers to insert the new node.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void insertAfter(Node* prevNode, int data) {
       if (prevNode == nullptr) {
           return; // Cannot insert after a null node
       }
       Node* newNode = new Node(data);
       newNode->next = prevNode->next;
       prevNode->next = newNode;
   }
   ```

### Deletion Operations:

#### 1. Deletion at the Beginning:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return.
   2. Store the address of the current head in a temporary pointer.
   3. Update the head to point to the next node.
   4. Delete the temporary pointer.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void deleteAtBeginning(Node*& head) {
       if (head == nullptr) {
           return; // List is empty, nothing to delete
       }
       Node* temp = head;
       head = head->next;
       delete temp;
   }
   ```

#### 2. Deletion at the End:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Check if the list is empty or has only one node. If so, delete the node and update the head.
   2. Traverse to the second last node.
   3. Set the `next` pointer of the second last node to null.
   4. Delete the last node.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void deleteAtEnd(Node*& head) {
       if (head == nullptr) {
           return; // List is empty, nothing to delete
       }
       if (head->next == nullptr) {
           delete head;
           head = nullptr;
           return;
       }
       Node* secondLast = head;
       while (secondLast->next->next != nullptr) {
           secondLast = secondLast->next;
       }
       delete secondLast->next;
       secondLast->next = nullptr;
   }
   ```

#### 3. Deletion After a Given Element:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Locate the node after which you want to delete a node.
   2. Adjust the `next` pointers to skip the node to be deleted.
   3. Delete the node.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void deleteAfter(Node* prevNode) {
       if (prevNode == nullptr || prevNode->next == nullptr) {
           return; // Cannot delete after a null node or the last node
       }
       Node* temp = prevNode->next;
       prevNode->next = temp->next;
       delete temp;
   }
   ```

### Deletion of a Specific Element:

- **Algorithm**:
   1. Locate the node to be deleted and its previous node.
   2. Adjust the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the node to be deleted.
   3. Delete the node.

- **Code Example (C++)**:
   ```cpp
   void deleteNode(Node*& head, int key) {
       Node* temp = head;
       if (temp != nullptr && temp->data == key) {
           head = temp->next;
           delete temp;
           return;
       }
       Node* prev = nullptr;
       while (temp != nullptr && temp->data != key) {
           prev = temp;
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       if (temp == nullptr) {
           return; // Key not found in the list
       }
       prev->next = temp->next;
       delete temp;
   }
   ```

These are the fundamental operations for insertion and deletion in a linked list. Keep in mind that these examples provide a basic understanding, and real-world implementations may vary depending on specific requirements and constraints.

------------------
## Doubly Linked List Data Structure

### Theory:

- **Definition**:
   - A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each element contains a data part and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node.

- **Advantages**:
   - Allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward).
   - Efficient for insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

- **Disadvantages**:
   - Requires more memory due to the extra pointer for each node.
   - Slightly more complex to implement and manage than a singly linked list.

### Node Structure:

- Each node in a doubly linked list contains:
   - Data
   - Pointer to the previous node (prev)
   - Pointer to the next node (next)

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
};
```

### Common Operations:

1. **Insertion**:
   - Adding a new node to the list.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Removing a node from the list.

3. **Traversal**:
   - Visiting each node in the list.

### Exceptions:

1. **Empty List**:
   - Attempting to perform operations on an empty list.

2. **Out of Bounds**:
   - Accessing an index that doesn't exist in the list.

3. **Memory Allocation Failure**:
   - Failing to allocate memory for a new node.

### Coding Examples:

#### Example 1: Insertion at the End

```cpp
void insertEnd(Node*& head, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = nullptr;

    if (head == nullptr) {
        newNode->prev = nullptr;
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != nullptr) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    temp->next = newNode;
    newNode->prev = temp;
}
```

#### Example 2: Deletion by Value

```cpp
void deleteNode(Node*& head, int value) {
    Node* temp = head;

    while (temp != nullptr && temp->data != value) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    if (temp == nullptr) {
        cout << "Node with value " << value << " not found." << endl;
        return;
    }

    if (temp->prev != nullptr) {
        temp->prev->next = temp->next;
    }

    if (temp->next != nullptr) {
        temp->next->prev = temp->prev;
    }

    delete temp;
}
```

#### Example 3: Traversal

```cpp
void printList(Node* head) {
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

#### Example 4: Handling Exceptions

```cpp
void insertAtIndex(Node*& head, int value, int index) {
    if (index < 0) {
        cout << "Invalid index." << endl;
        return;
    }

    // Insertion code...
}
```

These examples cover basic operations for a doubly linked list. Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases in real-world applications. Practice and experimentation will help solidify your understanding of doubly linked lists.


-------------------------
Certainly! Here are the notes for a Circular Linked List data structure, including theory, exceptions, and coding examples:

---

## Circular Linked List

### Theory:

- **Definition**:
   - A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points to the first node, creating a circular loop.

- **Properties**:
   - Unlike a regular linked list, there is no NULL pointer at the end of a circular linked list.
   - It can be implemented using a singly circular linked list or a doubly circular linked list.

- **Advantages**:
   - Efficient for operations that involve the end of the list, as there's no need to traverse the entire list.

- **Disadvantages**:
   - More complex to implement compared to a regular linked list.
   - Requires extra care when inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes.

### Common Operations:

1. **Insertion**:
   - Inserting a node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Removing a node from the list, including the first and last nodes.

3. **Traversal**:
   - Visiting each node in the list.

4. **Searching**:
   - Finding a specific node based on its value.

### Exceptions:

1. **Empty List**:
   - Handling operations on an empty circular linked list.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Special consideration for operations involving the first and last nodes.

### Coding Examples:

#### Example 1: Insertion at the Beginning

```cpp
// C++ Example
void insertAtBeginning(Node*& head, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(value);

    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = newNode;
        newNode->next = head;
    } else {
        Node* last = head;
        while (last->next != head)
            last = last->next;
        newNode->next = head;
        last->next = newNode;
        head = newNode;
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Deletion at the End

```cpp
// C++ Example
void deleteAtEnd(Node*& head) {
    if (head == nullptr) return;

    Node* temp = head;
    Node* prev = nullptr;

    while (temp->next != head) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    if (temp == head) {
        delete head;
        head = nullptr;
    } else {
        prev->next = head;
        delete temp;
    }
}
```

#### Example 3: Traversal

```cpp
// C++ Example
void traverse(Node* head) {
    if (head == nullptr) return;

    Node* temp = head;

    do {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    } while (temp != head);
}
```

#### Example 4: Handling Edge Cases

```cpp
// C++ Example
void deleteFirstNode(Node*& head) {
    if (head == nullptr) return;

    if (head->next == head) {
        delete head;
        head = nullptr;
    } else {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != head)
            temp = temp->next;
        temp->next = head->next;
        delete head;
        head = temp->next;
    }
}
```

---

These examples cover basic operations and handling common exceptions for a Circular Linked List. Remember to manage memory appropriately by deallocating nodes when necessary.

------------
Certainly! Here are practical use cases for Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, and Circular Linked Lists:

### Singly Linked List:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
   - When the number of elements in a list is not known in advance, a singly linked list can dynamically allocate memory for elements.

2. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - In applications like text editors or graphic design software, a singly linked list can be used to implement undo and redo functionality.

3. **Music Playlist**:
   - Each node can represent a song in a playlist, with the 'next' pointer pointing to the next song in the list.

4. **File System**:
   - Representing a hierarchical file system where each node represents a directory or a file, and the 'next' pointer points to the next sibling.

5. **Hash Table (Separate Chaining)**:
   - In hash tables, each bucket can be implemented as a linked list to handle collisions.

6. **Queue (Using Two Pointers)**:
   - A singly linked list can be used to implement a queue where 'head' points to the front and 'tail' points to the end.

### Doubly Linked List:

1. **Forward and Backward Traversal**:
   - In applications like browsers, a doubly linked list can be used to keep track of visited web pages, allowing for backward and forward navigation.

2. **Text Editors with Efficient Cursor Movement**:
   - Doubly linked lists allow efficient movement of the cursor both forward and backward in a text editor.

3. **LRU Cache**:
   - Least Recently Used (LRU) cache uses a doubly linked list to efficiently manage the order of elements based on their usage.

4. **Music Player with Shuffle Feature**:
   - A doubly linked list can be used to implement a playlist with features like shuffling, as it allows easy traversal in both directions.

5. **Undo/Redo Functionality (with Backward Traversal)**:
   - In some applications, a doubly linked list can be used to implement undo and redo functionality, allowing for backward traversal.

### Circular Linked List:

1. **Round-Robin Scheduling**:
   - In operating systems, a circular linked list can be used for round-robin scheduling, where each node represents a process and the scheduling is cyclic.

2. **Circular Buffers/Ring Buffers**:
   - In embedded systems or applications where memory is limited, circular linked lists can be used as circular buffers for efficient data storage.

3. **Music Playlist with Looping Feature**:
   - A circular linked list can be used to implement a playlist where the last song points to the first, allowing for continuous looping.

4. **Simulation of Processes in a Distributed System**:
   - Circular linked lists can be used to simulate processes that communicate in a distributed system, as the nodes can represent the processes.

5. **FIFO Queues with Limited Capacity**:
   - A circular linked list can be used as a FIFO queue with a fixed capacity, allowing for efficient use of limited resources.

These are just a few practical use cases for each type of linked list. The choice of which type to use depends on the specific requirements of the application.
