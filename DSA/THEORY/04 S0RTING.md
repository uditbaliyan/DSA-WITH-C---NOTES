Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to arrange data in a specific order. There are various types of sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. Here, I'll provide a brief overview of common sorting algorithms, along with code implementations, diagrams, and use cases for each.

### 1. **Bubble Sort**:

- **Description**:
  - Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Code Implementation (C++)**:
  ```cpp
  void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
      for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
              if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                  swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **Diagram**:

  ```
  Original Array: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
  Pass 1: [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
  Pass 2: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  Pass 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Bubble sort is useful for educational purposes and small datasets. It's not efficient for large lists.

### 2. **Selection Sort**:

- **Description**:
  - Selection sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.

- **Code Implementation (C++)**:
  ```cpp
  void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
      int i, j, min_idx;
      for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
          min_idx = i;
          for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
              if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                  min_idx = j;
              }
          }
          swap(arr[min_idx], arr[i]);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Diagram**:

  ```
  Original Array: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
  Pass 1: [1, 5, 4, 2, 8]
  Pass 2: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  Pass 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Selection sort is simple and easy to implement, but not efficient for large datasets.

### 3. **Insertion Sort**:

- **Description**:
  - Insertion sort builds a sorted region by iteratively inserting elements from the unsorted region into their correct positions in the sorted region.

- **Code Implementation (C++)**:
  ```cpp
  void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
      int i, key, j;
      for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
          key = arr[i];
          j = i - 1;
          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
              arr[j+1] = arr[j];
              j = j - 1;
          }
          arr[j+1] = key;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Diagram**:

  ```
  Original Array: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
  Pass 1: [1, 5, 4, 2, 8]
  Pass 2: [1, 4, 5, 2, 8]
  Pass 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  Pass 4: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Insertion sort is efficient for small datasets and nearly sorted lists.

### 4. **Merge Sort**:

- **Description**:
  - Merge sort divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

- **Code Implementation (C++)**:
  ```cpp
  void merge(int arr[], int left, int mid, int right) {
      int i, j, k;
      int n1 = mid - left + 1;
      int n2 = right - mid;
  
      int L[n1], R[n2];
  
      for (i = 0; i < n1; i++)
          L[i] = arr[left + i];
      for (j = 0; j < n2; j++)
          R[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];
  
      i = 0;
      j = 0;
      k = left;
  
      while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
          if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
              arr[k] = L[i];
              i++;
          } else {
              arr[k] = R[j];
              j++;
          }
          k++;
      }
  
      while (i <

 n1) {
          arr[k] = L[i];
          i++;
          k++;
      }
  
      while (j < n2) {
          arr[k] = R[j];
          j++;
          k++;
      }
  }
  
  void mergeSort(int arr[], int left, int right) {
      if (left < right) {
          int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
          mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
          mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);
          merge(arr, left, mid, right);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Diagram**:

  ```
  Original Array: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
  Pass 1: [27, 38, 43, 3, 9, 10, 82]
  Pass 2: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
  ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Merge sort is efficient for large datasets and provides stable sorting.

### 5. **Quick Sort**:

- **Description**:
  - Quick sort picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, such that elements smaller than the pivot are on its left, and elements greater than the pivot are on its right.

- **Code Implementation (C++)**:
  ```cpp
  int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
      int pivot = arr[high];
      int i = (low - 1);
  
      for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
          if (arr[j] < pivot) {
              i++;
              swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
          }
      }
      swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);
      return (i + 1);
  }
  
  void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
      if (low < high) {
          int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
  
          quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
          quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Diagram**:

  ```
  Original Array: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
  Pass 1: [27, 3, 9, 10, 38, 43, 82]
  Pass 2: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
  ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Quick sort is widely used due to its efficiency and is often used for sorting large datasets.

### 6. **Heap Sort**:

- **Description**:
  - Heap sort uses a binary heap data structure to build a max-heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element.

- **Code Implementation (C++)**:
  ```cpp
  void heapify(int arr[], int n, int i) {
      int largest = i;
      int left = 2 * i + 1;
      int right = 2 * i + 2;
  
      if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
          largest = left;
  
      if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
          largest = right;
  
      if (largest != i) {
          swap(arr[i], arr[largest]);
          heapify(arr, n, largest);
      }
  }
  
  void heapSort(int arr[], int n) {
      for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
          heapify(arr, n, i);
  
      for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          swap(arr[0], arr[i]);
          heapify(arr, i, 0);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Diagram**:

  ```
  Original Array: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
  Pass 1: [27, 9, 43, 3, 38, 82, 10]
  Pass 2: [9, 3, 43, 27, 38, 82, 10]
  Pass 3: [3, 9, 43, 27, 38, 82, 10]
  Pass 4: [9, 10, 43, 27, 38, 82, 3]
  Pass 5: [10, 27, 43, 38, 9, 82, 3]
  Pass 6: [27, 38, 43, 82, 10, 9, 3]
  ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Heap sort is efficient for large datasets and is often used in scenarios where stability is not a concern.

### Use Cases:

- **Bubble Sort**:
  - Educational purposes, small datasets for simplicity.

- **Selection Sort**:
  - Small datasets where simplicity and ease of implementation are more important than efficiency.

- **Insertion Sort**:
  - Nearly sorted lists, small datasets.

- **Merge Sort**:
  - Large datasets, situations where stable sorting is required.

- **Quick Sort**:
  - Large datasets, general-purpose sorting, applications where average-case performance is crucial.

- **Heap Sort**:
